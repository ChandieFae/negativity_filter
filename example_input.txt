The drinks were excellent and the appetizers came quickly.
They ignored our table for over 30 minutes and never apologized.
We were seated near the kitchen — completely unacceptable placement.
I had the worst experience with the front staff.
The atmosphere was nice, but the service was terrible.
I’m never coming back after how rude the staff was.
Dessert was good, but overall it was not worth it.
The manager blamed us — he said it was our fault.
They didn’t listen when I tried to explain the issue.
Totally unhelpful when we asked for substitutions.
